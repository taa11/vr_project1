VR Project for Vive Focus 3 Camera is broken but hands work if you set xr rig to track device

This is a tutorial project, provided by Unity. I follow the Vive Focus 3 tutorial for setup, but it does not work. Either I can get the camera to work, or the controllers, but not bot. This project currently has the controllers via STEAM VR plugin from the unity asset store, but that is when the camera disconnects.
